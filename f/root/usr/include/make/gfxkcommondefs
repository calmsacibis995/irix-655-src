# gfxkcommondefs - basic common flags/defs for gfx/kern builds
#
# Most Makefiles in gfx/kern will include this, so
# gfx/kern-specific build definitions should go here.
#
# At the moment, this file only contains makefile cruft to
# determine iwhat particular source tree we're building in,
# so that we may define anything that needs to be defined for
# a particular tree.  This makes it easier to keep one copy
# of the source building for multiple trees.
