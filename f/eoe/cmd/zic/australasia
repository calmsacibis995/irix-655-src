# Australia

# From John Mackin (March 6, 1991):
# We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as `daylight' time.
# It is called `summer' time.  Now by a happy coincidence, `summer'
# and `standard' happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
# abbreviation does _not_ change...
# The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
# in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
# initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
# the phrase `summer time' and does not use the phrase `daylight
# time'.
# Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
# Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases `Eastern Standard Time'
# or `Eastern Summer Time'.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
# current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
# on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
# prefixed by the word `Australian' when referring to local times;
# time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.

# From Arthur David Olson (March 8 1992):
# Given the above, what's chosen for year-round use is:
#	CST	for any place operating at a GMTOFF of 9:30
#	WST	for any place operating at a GMTOFF of 8:00
#	EST	for any place operating at a GMTOFF of 10:00

# From Paul Eggert (November 8, 1994):
# Shanks reports 2:00 for all autumn changes in Australia and New Zealand.
# Mark Prior <mrp@itd.adelaide.edu.au> writes that his newspaper
# reports that NSW's fall 1995 change will occur at 2:00,
# but Robert Elz says it's been 3:00 in Victoria since 1970
# and perhaps the newspaper's `2:00' is referring to standard time.
# And Robert Uzgalis <buz@cs.aukuni.ac.nz> says that the New Zealand Daylight
# Savings Time Order in Council dated 1990-06-18 specifies 2:00 standard
# time on both the first Sunday in October and the third Sunday in March.
# For now we'll continue to assume 3:00 for changes since 1970.

# Northern Territory

# From George Shepherd via Simon Woodhead via Robert Elz (March 6, 1991):
# # The NORTHERN TERRITORY..  [ Courtesy N.T. Dept of the Chief Minister ]
# #					[ Nov 1990 ]
# #	N.T. have never utilised any DST due to sub-tropical/tropical location.
# ...
# Zone        Australia/North         9:30    -       CST

# From Bradley White (March 4, 1991):

# the Northern Territory do[es] not have daylight saving.

# From John D. Newman via Bradley White (November 2, 1991):
# Western Australia is still on "winter time". Some DH in Sydney
# rang me at home a few days ago at 6.00am. (He had just arrived at
# work at 9.00am.)
# W.A. is switching to Summer Time on Nov 17th just to confuse

# The 1992 ending date used in the rules is a best guess;
# it matches what was used in the past.

# From Robert Elz (March 6, 1991):
# I believe that the current start date for DST is "lastSun" in Oct...
# that changed Oct 89.  That is, we're back to the
# original rule, and that rule currently applies in all the states
# that have dst, incl Qld.  (Certainly it was true in Vic).

# South Australia delays setting back our clocks for a few weeks."

# From Robert Elz (March 13, 1992):
# I heard that apparently (or at least, it appears that)
# South Aus will have an extra 3 weeks daylight saving every even
# numbered year (from 1990).  That's when the Adelaide Festival
# is on...

# From Robert Elz (March 16, 1992, 00:57:07 +1000):
# DST didn't end in Adelaide today (yesterday)....
# But whether it's "4th Sunday" or "2nd last Sunday" I have no idea whatever...
# (it's just as likely to be "the Sunday we pick for this year"...).

# From Bradley White (April 11, 1994):
# If Sun, 15 March, 1992 was at +1030 as kre asserts, but yet Sun, 20 March,
# 1994 was at +0930 as John Connolly's customer seems to assert, then I can
# only conclude that the actual rule is more complicated....

# From John Warburton <jwarb@SACBH.com.au> (1994-10-07):

# From Arthur David Olson:
# New South Wales and subjurisdictions have their own ideas of a fun time.
# Based on law library research by John Mackin (john@basser.cs.su.oz),
# who notes:
#	In Australia, time is not legislated federally, but rather by the
#	individual states.  Thus, while such terms as ``Eastern Standard Time''
#	[I mean, of course, Australian EST, not any other kind] are in common
#	use, _they have NO REAL MEANING_, as they are not defined in the
#	legislation.  This is very important to understand.

# Howse writes (p 162) that in 1879 the British governor of Fiji
# enacted an ordinance standardizing the islands on +12:00.
# Perhaps it didn't take.  We go with Shanks's more precise date in 1915.

# In comp.risks 14.87 (26 August 1993), Peter Neumann writes:
# I wonder what happened in Kwajalein, where there was NO Friday,
# August 20, 1993.  Thursday night at midnight Kwajalein switched sides with
# respect to the International Date Line, to rejoin its fellow islands,
# going from 11:59 p.m. Thursday to 12:00 m. Saturday in a blink.

# Howse writes (p 162) ``The Spaniards, on the other hand, reached the

# Ignore this for now, as we have no hard data.  See also Asia/Manila.
