Terms:
  The build directory refers to the name of the directory where the source
  product was installed.  A copy of this file should reside in the build
  directory.  The symbol "BLD_DIR" refers to the build directory.


Build information:
   To build both eoe and irix, simply change your working directory (cd) to
   the build directory (BLD_DIR) and issue the command "make".

   To only build either eoe, irix or hippi, invoke make as above with the
   appropriate target (e.g. make eoe).


   To build a subset of of a source tree:

     1) Set the environment variable "WORKAREA" to the name of the
        build directory.

     2) Set the environment variable "ROOT" to the name of the
        root directory (BLD_DIR/root).

     3) Set the environment variable "TOOLROOT" to the name of the
        tool root directory (BLD_DIR/troot).

     4) Set the environment variable "SRC_PRD" to 1.
   
     5) Change your working directory (cd) to the build directory and
        issue the command "make buildable" to load the build files.

     6) Change your working directory (cd) to the directory which 
        contains the source to build from and issue the command
        "make default".


Build notes:
   The make targets "headers" and "exports" need not be built and
   may not build properly.  Therefore, changes to the files which
   are operated upon by the "headers" and/or "exports" targets
   should be made to the build root as well as to the build area
   prior to performing a build.

   The "clean" target of the main make description file remove all
   files which are not part of the source product (i.e. all files
   not listed in the file "file.lst").  Therefore, any files which
   are added and should survive a "make clean" should be added to
   the "file.lst" file and the "file.lst" file should then be sorted.

   The source files and build files can be loaded separately.  Make
   sure that the appropriate files have been loaded prior to performing
   a build.

   A test build for this product was performed on a Origin machine which
   was running the latest version of IRIX.  Other build machines or
   configurations may not be supported.
