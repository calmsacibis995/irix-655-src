The diags in this directory were written for debugging specific 
RR SRAM problems. They are meant to be used in conjunction with
rrdbg. To use, run the make, then copy the resultant *.fw files,
along with the listing files *.list, and the diag.tcl file to some
directory on the target system.

On the target system, cd to that directory, run rrdbg there in the
mode which puts the LINC in reset (i.e. no "-l" flag), so:

1. rrdbg <-S or -D> [-i ioslot]
     (-S specifies SRC LINC, i.e. LINC 1, -D specifies Dst LINC i.e. LINC 0)

2. Now source the diag.tcl file to pick up the defined procedures:
   rr_dbg> source diag.tcl

3. To run host-based SRAM tests built into rrdbg, 10, 100 or 1000 times:
   rr_dbg> s10
   rr_dbg> s100
   rr_dbg> s1k

4. To run walking 1 test 1, 10, 100 times
   rr_dbg> w1 
   rr_dbg> w10
   rr_dbg> w100

5. To run data=address test 1, 10, 100 times:
   rr_dbg> deqa1 
   rr_dbg> deqa10
   rr_dbg> deqa100

6. To run data=~address test 1, 10, 100 times:
   rr_dbg> deqna1 
   rr_dbg> deqna10
   rr_dbg> deqna100
